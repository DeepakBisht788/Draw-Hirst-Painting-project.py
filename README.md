# Colorful Dot Pattern with Turtle

This Python program uses the **turtle** module to create a colorful pattern on the screen. The turtle moves in a specific direction, drawing random-colored dots and forming a grid-like design with lines and dots.

## Features
- **Random Colored Dots**: Each dot is randomly colored using RGB values.
- **Pattern Creation**: The turtle moves in a set pattern, drawing dots along its path.
- **Grid Design**: The pattern includes both horizontal and vertical lines, each with randomly colored dots.

## How It Works
1. The turtle moves forward and places a random-colored dot.
2. It creates a diagonal line, then switches to draw a grid pattern by alternating between horizontal and vertical lines.
3. The dots along the lines are randomly colored, creating a vibrant and unique pattern.
